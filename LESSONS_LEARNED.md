# PEG Error Recovery — the living record

Seventy-odd engines across six architectural lines were built, measured, and
archived to reach the c-series: one algebra refined engine by engine, ending
at c12 — the first to beat the long c6–c10 judgment plateau, and the only one
that is smaller and faster than its predecessors at the same time. This file
records the yardstick, the standing results, the critical
lessons, and the refutations that must not be retried. Everything else — the
era-1/era-2 history (insights I1–I107 in long form), the last full
twelve-engine table, and the archived lines' detailed accounts — is preserved
in `dart/experiments/recovery/attic/OLD_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`.

## 1. The problem and the yardstick

An engine receives a grammar and a damaged document and must return the best
complete reading: a tree over the real input, with `SyntaxError` nodes
marking exactly what was denied (real text judged noise) or owed (text
judged missing). Directives: no second parse over a repaired string (D1); no
arbitrary constants (D2); never invent characters of an open class,
structural completion is fine (D7); the two acceptance readings of D8
(`,3true` → `,3,true`; `[,2,` → `[2,`).

**The battery** (`astdiff.dart`): every single-character mutation of every
corpus document that breaks the parse, plus truncations and two-site damage,
across three grammars — json, a statement language (blocks/if/assign), and
left-recursive arithmetic. Expectations come from the frozen parser reading
the undamaged original, so no engine can be tuned toward them. Scoring is
Levenshtein distance over named-node skeletons. Five categories, named by
the operation a person performed: truncation, deletion, insertion,
substitution, misc. Curation (I107): operator coin-flips and 1–2-character
truncation stubs are not generated, and truncation expectations drop
left-recursion wrappers whose evidence lies beyond the cut — the battery
asks only questions a human could answer.

**The gates** (all must pass; the battery cannot see them by construction):
- `_accept` — D8's readings: cx2, b1, b2.
- `_freespan` — may a repair delete real input that already matched?
- `_recommit` — does the engine keep a committed construct rather than
  re-reading the healthy prefix as something else?
- `_conf1` — exact repair-cost conformance, no free passes for predicates.

## 2. The standing table (era-3 battery, 2026-08-21)

| Engine | Score | Perfect% | ms | LOC | Gates | truncation | deletion | insertion | substitution | misc |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **c12** | **0.9896** | **85.8** | **624** | **784** | all | 0.997 | 0.984 | 0.993 | **0.997** | **0.969** |
| c9 | 0.9879 | 84.0 | 633 | 890 | all | 0.997 | 0.984 | 0.993 | 0.988 | 0.968 |
| c10 | 0.9879 | 84.0 | 737 | 785 | all | 0.997 | 0.984 | 0.993 | 0.988 | 0.968 |
| c11 | 0.9874 | 84.7 | ~1,926,000 | 815 | all | — | — | — | — | — |
| c8 | 0.9879 | 84.0 | 955 | 738 | all | 0.997 | 0.984 | 0.993 | 0.988 | 0.968 |
| c7 | 0.9879 | 84.0 | 1181 | 692 | all | 0.997 | 0.984 | 0.993 | 0.988 | 0.968 |
| c6 | 0.9879 | 84.0 | 1180 | 707 | all | 0.997 | 0.984 | 0.993 | 0.988 | 0.968 |

**c12 is the standing engine**: it is the only row that beats the long
c6–c10 plateau on judgment (+0.0017 score, +1.8 perfect, substitution
0.988 → 0.997), and it does so while being the smallest and, on the
paired clock, the fastest. Its four gate results are exact: `_accept`
ok cx2=1 b1=1 b2=1, `_freespan` PASS, `_conf1` costs `0 1 1 0 2 3`,
`_recommit` 16/16 — all re-run on 2026-08-21 for c9, c10, c11 and c12
together, and all four engines pass all four.

The c9/c10/c12 ms in the table are same-session single battery runs
(2026-08-21); the durable numbers are the paired ones below. c11's
figure is not a typo and was not re-measured here: its battery takes
about 1,926 SECONDS, three orders of magnitude off the others, so the
run was cut short deliberately (see the c11 entry in §4 — the cost is
a ~30-case cap-out tail, and it is why c11 is a study, not a candidate).
c11's category columns are left blank for the same reason; its recorded
score and coverage come from its own session.

**Paired latency, split by input kind** (`_c12lat.dart 21`, all three
engines interleaved on one warmed VM, two consecutive samples, medians;
clean = every corpus document parsed 20x, damaged = one pass over the
battery):

| Engine | clean vs c9 | damaged vs c9 |
|---|---|---|
| c9 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| c10 | 2.43x, 2.55x | 1.130x, 1.129x |
| **c12** | **0.949x, 0.982x** | **0.977x, 0.978x** |

This split corrects a figure this file carried since 2026-08-19. c10's
cost against c9 was recorded as a single blended 1.073 from full-battery
reps; measured by input kind it is not one tax but two very different
ones — 1.13x on damaged input, but **2.4–2.6x on clean input**, where
c10's one-machine design pays dispatch on every consult that c9's
dedicated plain parser answered directly. The blended median hid it
because the damaged battery dominates the wall clock. c12 is at or
below c9 on both kinds, which is the first time any engine in the
series has been smaller AND faster than c9 rather than trading one for
the other. (Measured two-arm, without c10 interleaved, c12's clean
ratio reads lower still — 0.81–0.93x across samples; this machine's
noise band is wide, so the safe claim is "at or below c9 on both", not
a precise speedup.)

The c9/c8 ms are the SAME-SESSION paired medians (12 interleaved
full-battery reps on one warmed VM, 2026-08-19): ratio 0.587, so c9 is
1.7x faster on bit-identical judgment — every battery tree equal,
verified by a zero-diff dump, and every gate exact. c8 therefore joins
the attic. (c8's former table figure of 1,126 ms was the 2026-08-06
quiet-machine run; the c7/c6 rows keep their own last measurements, so
ms is only comparable WITHIN a measuring session — the c9:c8 ratio is
the durable number.) c9's higher line count is the price of its caches;
c8's LOC is restated at today's normalized count (738; the 759 recorded
earlier predates the strict-zero-fiber trim). c10 was paired against
c9 in its own session (10 interleaved full-battery reps, 2026-08-19):
medians 574/616, ratio 1.073 — its judgment is bit-identical to c9's,
so its row differs only in ms and LOC. (Its first cut measured 1.30x
at 714 lines; the fiber split described under I119 bought the ratio
down to ~1.07-1.09 — the band this machine's noise spans — for 76
lines, and the state-space pass under I120 gave back 5 of them.) The
c9/c10 pair was for two days a deliberate frontier — c9 the fast point,
c10 the small point — and c12 has since collapsed it: it is left of
both on every axis, so the frontier is one engine again.

The c6–c10 rows are the FUSED engine — the full squirrel parser folded
in, so each is self-contained and its LOC includes the whole parser
(~246 lines); the pre-fold, library-dependent c6 measured 461 lines and
~1,500 ms. c11 and c12 return to the published library untouched plus a
separate recovery module, so their LOC is NOT the same quantity as
c6–c10's. Two corrections in opposite directions, both worth knowing
before the LOC column is read as a ranking:

- c11/c12 do not carry the ~246 folded-in parser lines, which flatters
  them against c6–c10;
- c9 and c10 cannot be run at all without `_convert.dart`, a 120-line
  adapter that translates library clauses into each engine's own node
  classes and lives in the harness rather than the engine. c11 and c12
  consume the library's clause objects natively and need no adapter, so
  the honest totals are c9 ≈ 890+, c10 ≈ 785+, against c12's 784 flat.

The two effects do not cancel exactly and no attempt is made here to
net them; the durable claim is the narrower one, that **c12 is smaller
than c11 (815) and than c10 (785) counted the same way, by the same
script, in the same session**, which is the comparison the c12 brief
asked for. The c1–c8 ancestors and every other line are archived with
their last numbers in the attic (`attic/OLD_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`).

## 3. The critical lessons

### The architecture — three discoveries that define the design

1. **The LR grow-loop IS the recovery loop** (I100, the pivotal insight).
   A mismatch and a left-recursion seed are the same object: a suspended
   reading addressed by (clause, position). The memo entry's grow-loop
   serves left recursion and repair with no second mechanism — left
   recursion is recovery at cost zero. Everything else in the design is
   this loop plus a way to price what it grows.

2. **Parsing mode IS budget zero** (I101), **and the budget is the
   horizon** (A3). With no edits left, the costed descent is
   definitionally the pure parser, so the frozen memo answers
   unconditionally — every spent-out continuation is O(1) to the end of
   the input. The budget ladder is not an optimization: deleting it was
   ~100x latency, twice. The budget marks where repair can no longer
   reach, and the mode split disappears into it.

3. **Judgment must be whole-document and simultaneous.** The b-line's
   greedy commit-then-resume architecture has a proven ceiling (0.88):
   the correct choice between a cheap fill and a dear denial depends on
   repairs not yet made. Every reading must be priced against every
   rival over the whole document before anything commits. (The archived
   chart line achieved simultaneity by re-deriving what the parse knew;
   the c-line achieves it inside the one descent.)

### The judgment — what a reading is worth

4. **The rank is one quantity at two resolutions, split at the boundary**
   (I105 + I111). Five keys, each placed by a named failing case: fewest
   claims (edits + fees + the derived swallow) → PEG's own reading →
   most explained (net) → latest doubt → fewest obligations stranded at
   the cut. Tier 1 prices all wrongness with the boundary claim
   collapsed to one (I94); the last tier restores exactly the
   cardinality tier 1 forgot and nothing else — mid-document owes are
   fully priced up front, and recounting them below was
   double-representation (measured inert; removed). Ablations: drop
   latest-doubt −3.4 perfect, drop the stranded count −2.6, collapse the
   stranded count to a bit −2.6 (identical to dropping the tier: the
   count IS the tier). The root's admission is the rank's own price.

5. **The swallow is derived, never stored** (I108). A reading that
   absorbed more of its span than it pinned pays one — computed at every
   comparison from scalars the way carries (`absorbed > net`, relative
   to the comparing front's position), accumulated never. Idempotent, so
   double-charging is unrepresentable; the stored-toll design needed
   three fields, a judge, symmetry rules, and a root exception, and cost
   a two-session bug class. The span conservation law underneath:
   `span = net + absorbed + del`.

6. **The boundary claim is one, and it is idempotent** (I94 + I110).
   "The document stopped" charges once however many slots it strands.
   Structurally: the budget is an ADDITIVE ledger — the fold splits it
   by `full − spend`, so only quantities that add along `then` may enter
   spend. Pricing the eof bit into spend re-charges it at every nesting
   level that touches EOI, and deep truncation spines die at nesting
   boundaries (−0.0019, truncation 0.997→0.990). Additive: del, gap,
   net, fees, oweN. Idempotent, derived at use: the eof bit (a theorem:
   `oweN > 0 ⟺ owing ∧ end == n`), the swallow.

7. **The five counters are the floor** (I111). del and gap are split by
   the witness antisymmetry — a denial is witnessed by the input, an
   obligation only by the grammar; they trade 1:1 in the price, but
   `absorbed` needs denied-chars alone and the fee condition needs the
   owe count alone. oweN is the boundary cardinality (measured, −2.6 to
   collapse). net is evidence, orthogonal by the span law. fees is the
   exchange-rate correction where the two witness-kinds meet at par — an
   unspellable fill loses to an available denial at equal price
   (I72∩I36), it must outrank net (gate-pinned), a slot that is a
   back-edge into a growing cell is an LR seed and exempt (I106), and it
   can never be an owe: folding it into gap was battery-identical with
   every gate green and is rejected anyway, because a fee'd way that
   legitimately wins would report an edit the tree cannot show. A
   judgment charge must not forge an evidence mark.

8. **The tie law**: the latest same-price rival holds the bucket —
   deterministic, because expansion order is; measured four ways
   (first-keeps −2.6 to −3.1 perfect). A tie never signals improvement,
   or rank-equal rivals spin forever.

9. **Names are evidence** (I81/I96). A zero-width completion at the end
   of the input loses its name — the construct was never reached;
   mid-document it keeps it. The audit identity follows: the winner's
   reported cost equals the errors its tree actually shows.

### The representation — how the search stays cheap and honest

10. **The way is a cons cell that knows its sums** (I109). One payload (a
    denied/owed mark, a finished subtree, or a name over an inner chain),
    one tail; every scalar is either an additive cache of that list
    (del, gap, net, fees, oweN) or derived at the point of use (edits,
    marks, the eof bit, the swallow). The tree is a fold over the chain;
    the tree's cost is the way's own sums by construction; a frozen read
    is one constructor; the unread tail at the root is one more skip,
    not a protocol. c5's fifteen fields were one reading described three
    times — the giveaway was the root walking the finished tree to
    recompute a number the way already carried. Corollary, the method
    that found it: **derive, don't account** — when a stored quantity
    needs machinery to prevent double-counting, derive it at use.

11. **The way-front is the memo cell** (I103). One champion per ending,
    decided at insertion — insertion IS the improvement test, so the
    grow-loop stops when no add improves; no sort, no unstable-tie
    livelock. Warth's involved-set is the staleness rule: only rules
    that read a growing seed, at that position, during that growth, are
    ever recomputed. The seed is read RAW (a budget filter there hides
    the repair-carrying ways growth must build on), and any in-path hit
    is left recursion.

12. **Laziness is load-bearing** (I88, confirmed three times): building
    trees eagerly costs 20–31% at the tie-refresh volume the tie law
    requires; only winners are materialized. Same family: cache on
    stable identities (caching net on a freshly allocated wrapper never
    hits and cost 12%), and a literal is a char-sequence run through the
    ordinary fold (I95) — its replace edit stays literal-scoped, and
    routing literals through the memo cell was judgment-identical but
    +25% latency.

13. **Fold the parser in; put behavior on the nodes and state on the
    behavior** (the c6 fusion). The engine converts the grammar once into
    its own node hierarchy — each clause kind carries match (pure), go
    (priced), freeze, det, fill and pin as methods, and its own memo rows
    as generation-stamped arrays, so no type dispatch and no hash map sit
    on the hot path and a new input resets everything by bumping one
    counter. Judgment-identical, −20% latency; the one remaining type
    inspection is the conversion adapter, and the one tree walk
    (`_netOf`) sits at the package-tree boundary. The pure fiber's seven
    small match methods are the price of budget-zero answers being O(1) —
    routing budget-zero through the way machinery is the measured-slower
    direction.

14. **One left-recursion law for both fibers** (I112, the c7 collapse).
    Squirrel's rule — re-entry seeds the cell, growth bumps the
    position's version, a cell is valid only at its stamped version — now
    governs the priced fiber too. The refinement that made it affordable:
    a cell whose compute never read a growing seed cannot go stale, and
    THE INVOLVED SET IS ONE BOOLEAN recorded by the unwind (every
    enclosing grow when a seed is read is by definition an ancestor on
    the path), so Warth's recursion stack, heads map, tick counter and
    per-cell sets delete. Validity: `at ≥ budget && (!dep || ver ==
    rver[pos])`. Judgment-identical and faster than the machinery it
    replaced; the version rule WITHOUT the dep bit is sound but −13%
    (it cold-starts every same-position cell per growth step). The
    version-bump-refuted-for-recovery result was an artifact of c2's
    normalize-everything architecture, where every position grew;
    with repetitions as closures, growth is sparse again.

### The method — how the lessons were won

15. **The yardstick is a design object** (I107). A battery that scores
    coin flips or post-cut structure measures tie-luck. Curate mutations
    to what a human could arguably answer, and make every
    expectation-change in the open.

16. **Keep gates the metric cannot see.** The battery is blind by
    construction to free-span deletion and prefix re-reading — it once
    rewarded +0.0020 for exactly the behavior `_freespan` exists to
    forbid. And a gate must be checked to be checking: the era-3
    curation accidentally emptied freespan's probe list, and every
    "pass" until the restoration was vacuous. Verify the gate fails for
    a known-bad engine.

17. **Domination is arithmetic; ablation is measurement.** Compute the
    frontier (`pareto.py`), never eyeball it — the hand-kept list was
    wrong twice the same way. Every kept mechanism carries the number
    that keeps it (the size floor is a measurement, I104); every removed
    one carries the number that killed it (the ledger below).

### The machine — what the c9 round measured

18. **Measure the shape before choosing the container** (I115). The
    histograms came first, the design second: 71% of cell consults see
    at most one reading (90% at most three), 80% of fold steps hold one
    partial, and the champion map's key always equaled the stored
    reading's own `end`. Those three numbers make the map a list, the
    hash a linear scan, and the rebuilt-per-consult view a cached one —
    together 1.7x — while every change made WITHOUT a shape measurement
    behind it (the per-op campaign) was ±5% noise.

19. **The GC owns the allocation ledger** (I116). Under Dart's
    generational collector, a young object that dies young is nearly
    free, and a store into an old-space object pays a write barrier the
    fresh array never does. Both directions were measured: judging a
    candidate from its component sums BEFORE allocating it lost
    1.02–1.04x (the guard duplicates the arithmetic on every keep, the
    allocation it avoids was free), and reusing cell arrays ACROSS runs
    with epoch stamps and in-place resets lost 1.10x (every store aged).
    "Avoid allocation" is not an optimization goal; it is a hypothesis
    the collector usually falsifies.

20. **A ratio is only comparable within its session.** Even the paired
    in-process interleaved instrument drifts with machine load: a
    candidate measured 0.938 re-measured 1.033 when the machine
    lightened (the baseline sped up more than the candidate). Draw
    conclusions only from same-session pairs, and re-confirm any
    surprising ratio before acting on it — the c9 round's one false
    lead was a load artifact, not an engine effect.

21. **A blended ratio can hide two opposite taxes** (the c10 correction,
    2026-08-21). c10's cost against c9 was carried for two days as a
    single 1.073 from full-battery reps. Split by input kind it is 1.13x
    on damaged input and 2.4–2.6x on CLEAN input: the damaged battery
    dominates the wall clock, so the blended median all but erased a
    2.5x regression on the path most real documents take. Whenever an
    engine has two paths with different volumes, time them separately
    or the cheap-but-frequent one goes unmeasured.

### The repair — what a substitution must prove (the c12 round)

22. **A swap the rest of the sequence cannot read from is a guess, not a
    substitution** (I121). The replace repair consumes one wrong
    character in place of an exact-text slot. Offered unconditionally it
    is also the entire damaged-latency cost of the c12 design: compiled
    out, c12 was already cheaper than c9 on every hot damaged case. It
    is expensive for a structural reason, not a constant-factor one —
    each swap resumes at `end + 1`, a position the search would
    otherwise never visit, so the memo misses cascade downstream (2.8x
    the propose calls on the worst case), and because per-end pruning
    picks its survivor with a LOCAL comparator, a swap-derived reading
    can evict the chain that would have finished more cheaply and buy a
    whole extra budget round. The gate is the price of belief:
    `_resumes` requires the remaining slots to read cleanly from just
    after the swap and prove something, or the sequence to end there.
    −27% `then` calls, battery bit-identical, damaged 1.06x → 0.98x.
    The general form: a repair that opens a position no clean reading
    reaches must justify that position, or it pays for the whole
    subtree the search then has to explore.

23. **Where a repair is OFFERED is a design axis, not a detail.** The
    same substitution rule, unchanged in what it costs or what it
    accepts, measured 1.198x, 1.110x, 1.06x and 0.98x purely by moving
    and gating its offer site: from `Terminal.findReadings` (fired at
    every failing picky terminal) into `_readSlots`; then restricted to
    a clean prefix; then to a PREFERRED prefix with budget room; then
    to slots the sequence can resume past. Every one of those four
    tightenings held the battery bit-identical. A repair's expense lives
    in how often it is proposed, not in what it does when it wins.

## 4. The c-series arc — what each engine taught

- **c1** (I101): the budget-zero collapse. The two-mode split (parse vs
  repair) is not a feature of the problem, only of earlier designs — the
  pure parser is the zero fiber of the costed descent. 0.9818, 493 lines.
- **c2** (I102): the four-form normalization (X* is left recursion, X? is
  choice, a literal is a char-sequence, EOI is a slot) — the smallest
  engine ever above 0.98 (454 lines) and the proof that grammar rewriting
  as a FOUNDATION costs accuracy and produces trees foreign to the
  author's grammar. The behavioral laws survive; the rewriting does not.
- **c3** (I103): the way-front as the memo cell; Warth's involved-set;
  the sort and its livelock class deleted. Porting truths: the seed is
  read raw; gating foundLR on a null container silently turns growth off.
- **c4** (I104–I107): the completed rank — every key traced to a family;
  the fee's seed exemption; the literal replace edit; eof-is-not-spend.
  The residual then classified: mostly yardstick, not engine (→ era-3
  curation). Proved the size floor is a measurement: nine collapses below
  ~511 lines each broke a recorded bar.
- **c5** (I108): the swallow derived, never stored — toll, vouch, judge,
  and the vouch-symmetry bug class deleted; judgment bit-identical.
- **c6** (I109–I111, then the fusion): the way as a cons cell that knows
  its sums (fifteen fields → ten); the root protocol and audit walk
  deleted; the pentad audit — admission is the rank's own price, tier 5
  is the stranded count alone, and the five counters are proven the
  floor (0.9879 / 84.0 / ~1490 ms / 461 lines). Then the whole squirrel
  parser folded in: an engine-owned node hierarchy with behavior as
  methods and memo state as stamped arrays on the nodes —
  judgment-identical and −20% latency, 707 lines all told.
- **c7** (I112): one left-recursion law for both fibers — re-entry
  seeds, growth bumps the position's version, and the involved set is a
  single boolean recorded by the unwind; Warth's stack, heads map, tick
  and sets delete. Judgment-identical, 0.9879 / 84.0 / ~1112 ms / 692
  lines, every gate exact — the first engine to hold the accuracy AND
  latency records at once.
- **c8** (I113): the adversarial audit, and one frozen-answer protocol.
  Every assumption re-questioned; most held with sharper reasons (the
  clean-cell rivals are load-bearing — b1's winner SPLITS a purely
  matching "33"; the pure fiber stays dual code; the ladder stays).
  What changed: freeze(pos) is the single frozen-answer protocol at
  every node kind (go = freeze-or-repair; grow's budget zero calls it;
  a terminal's pin bit is the leaf case of the net walk), and the rule
  cell owns its frozen way, built once. Judgment-identical, every gate
  exact — the standing engine. The audit's two new refutations are in
  the ledger; the design is visibly at a fixed point (c5→c6 cut 73
  lines, c6→c7 one law, c7→c8 one protocol). c8 was then renamed and
  re-documented end to end for readers without this file's history —
  every invented term replaced (section 8), every mechanism explained in
  plain language in the source, judgment re-verified identical — and
  finished with the strict zero fiber: budget-zero queries always get
  exactly the plain parser's cached answer, making the zero fiber
  order-independent and ~5% faster. 0.9879 / 84.0 / ~1126 ms / 759
  lines, every gate exact, analyzer-clean.
- **c9** (I115–I116): the same algorithm on the data its measured shape
  asks for — 1.7x faster (paired ratio 0.587), judgment bit-identical
  (zero-diff dump), every gate exact. The round began by measuring the
  SHAPE of the hot structures over the whole battery: 71% of cell
  consults see at most one reading (90% at most three, max 52); 80% of
  fold steps hold one partial; and every champion-map insert used the
  stored reading's own `end` as its key. Three changes follow from
  those numbers and account for the whole win: the champion map becomes
  a plain list scanned by `end` (the key was the value's own field);
  a cell's filtered view is cached between changes, and its object
  identity — which now changes exactly when content may — lets a rule
  reference cache its labeled wrapping and revalidate by `identical`;
  and naming moves from per-fill to per-change, applied as the view is
  built (with the packaged plain answers — zero-budget reading, its
  list, a reference's tree wrapper — each built at most once). Two
  "obvious" moves measured backwards and were reverted: judging a
  candidate before allocating it (1.02–1.04x) and reusing cell arrays
  across runs via epoch stamps (1.10x) — Dart's generational GC makes
  young allocation nearly free and charges a write barrier for
  old-space stores, so the fresh-arrays-per-run design c6 chose is not
  a shortcut but the optimum. The per-op campaign around these
  (indexed loops, fold micro-shapes, terminal tweaks) measured ±5%
  with unstable sign: on this engine the representation, not the
  operations, was the lever.
- **c10** (I117–I118): one machine at every budget. The dedicated
  plain parser c9 still carried for the zero fiber is deleted; a
  budget-zero consult runs the SAME costed descent with nothing to
  spend. Three laws make the collapse exact to the tree and the label:
  WITH NO BUDGET LEFT, REPAIR IS PARSING (the zero fiber's one
  PREFERRED reading — greedy demotion strips "the parser's own choice"
  from every reading the greedy parser would not produce — IS the
  plain answer); EACH FIBER OWNS ITS STORE AND ITS CLOCK (budget-zero
  fills the cell's twin, each fiber grows left recursion on its own
  version clock, and ties follow the fiber: the costed search keeps
  the newcomer, the zero fiber keeps the incumbent, because a fixed
  point discards an equal re-derivation); SHARING FOLLOWS THE VIEW
  (every packaged answer is cached by the identity of the view it was
  built over, so the first asker builds it and every later asker
  shares the same object — label sharing is observable, so this is
  correctness, not tuning). Bit-identical trees (zero-diff dump plus a
  node-by-node oracle over all 2101 cases), every gate exact,
  890 → 790 lines (−11%) at a measured ~1.09x paired latency — c9
  keeps the latency point. I118 is the boundary of I116's ledger,
  found by compressing past the knee and bisecting back: routing the
  two per-candidate hot paths (the slot walk, the store's view build)
  through the shared judge — an intermediate list per store, a judging
  cell with its cache bookkeeping per offer — measured 1.18x slower
  end to end (paired ratio 1.30 → 1.57), so those two sites inline
  the rules the helpers state. Young allocation is nearly free; a
  per-offer allocation plus invalidation writes in the innermost loop
  is not just allocation.
- **c10, second pass** (I119): the plain parse is a FACE of each
  construct, not a mode of the search. c10's first cut ran the zero
  fiber through the costed machinery's full shape — a memo cell per
  composite, a list of candidates per consult, a tree translation per
  serve — and measured 1.30x against c9. Instrumented attribution
  (stopwatch around every zero-fiber entry) put essentially the WHOLE
  gap in that fiber: the costed rounds were already at parity. The fix
  is a fiber split inside each construct: `proposePlain` is the
  classic PEG parse — one preferred reading, its finished tree built
  as it returns (`_node`), children consulted through the
  single-reading `plainReading`, no lists between stores — and
  `proposeReadings` is the costed candidate generation; `_grow` fills
  the same cells with whichever face the fiber calls for, and inside a
  twin fill inline composites skip cells entirely, so the zero fiber
  memoizes only at rule boundaries, exactly the plain parser's own
  shape. Readings-with-trees stay sound because in the zero fiber
  every consult is served at most one preferred reading, so every
  chain is deterministic and demotion has already discarded whatever
  the greedy parser would not produce. Bit-identical at every step
  (four gate-verified stages: lean proposals 1.30 → 1.20, cell bypass
  → ~1.17, eager trees → ~1.13, single-reading consults → ~1.09);
  the residual ~9% is the dispatch tax of one machine choosing its
  fiber per consult, below this VM's run-to-run noise. 714 → 790
  lines: the second face costs 76 lines and buys back most of the
  deleted parser's speed.
- **c10, third pass** (I120): the state a variable holds is only real
  if some read distinguishes it. A reachability audit of the engine's
  state cross-product found two collapses and confirmed the rest is
  load-bearing. Landed: `_round` deleted (written everywhere, read
  only to copy into `_budget` — the ladder now loops on `_budget`
  itself), and the per-fiber version clocks merged into ONE
  (bit-identical, gates, ratio 1.073: a cross-fiber bump can only
  force a refill that re-derives the same content, because the plain
  parse is deterministic and a zero cell keeps its incumbent on ties —
  so the stores must be disjoint but the clock need not be). Refuted
  by the oracle: one-sided zeroWraps (769/2101 differ — `_r10`
  compares tree labels by POINTER, so which RuleRef built a shared
  wrap is observable; the dump text stayed identical, meaning the
  two-sidedness exists solely to reproduce c9's first-asker choices).
  That same mechanism analytically refutes deleting the wrap caches,
  un-sharing refView, and merging `_probing` into `_zeroFill` (both
  would shift wrap sides/pointers). 790 → 785 lines.
- **c11** (the code-space study, `c11_study.md`): the pure parser re-run
  under directive sets — uniform-cost search over restarts, no chart,
  the library untouched. It scores 0.9874 / 84.7 with all four gates:
  −0.0005 on score, **+0.7 on coverage** against the c9/c10 plateau,
  which is why it is in the record at all. One structural zero remains
  (i=168, same-cell left recursion — the repair consults (Value,0) while
  that cell is in progress; only a chart serves it). Its veto
  (challenge) directive is free in charge but pays one unit of QUEUE
  ORDER — free in both is a random walk, priced in both loses ties the
  evidence key should decide — with sites read off the returned tree and
  `run.discarded` only where an enclosing match ends at the failure
  frontier, cuts of one repetition never composing, no two consecutive
  vetoes (which bounds vetoes at edits+1 and keeps the charge bands
  finite), and rings admitted in bulk because per-level draining starves
  the far family. Its search needs TWO clocks over one frontier, found
  only after three full batteries: queue-cost bands with the furthest
  parent frontier first before a candidate exists (greedy, so capped
  multi-error searches complete something), charge bands FIFO within
  after one does (the only starvation-free rival hunt — both frontier
  extremes livelocked, 18 regressions near-end and 22 far-end). The
  verdict is the closing sentence of the study: **a restart engine
  re-derives what a chart holds.** Its battery takes ~1,926 seconds
  against c9's 0.6, all of it in a ~30-case cap-out tail. c11 is kept
  as a study and as the source of c12's architecture, not as a
  candidate.
- **c12** (I121, the standing engine): the best of c9, c10 and c11 in
  one file. From c11 it takes the architecture — the published library
  untouched, a separate recovery module consuming library clauses
  natively, so no `_convert.dart` adapter exists for it. From c10 it
  takes the one-machine design and the state-space discipline. From c9
  it takes the measured containers of I115 and the caches that make the
  clean path fast. It is the first engine to break the c6–c10 judgment
  plateau: **0.9896 / 85.8**, substitution 0.988 → 0.997 and misc
  0.968 → 0.969, all four gates exact, 784 lines, and on the paired
  clock at or below c9 on both clean and damaged input. The judgment
  gain is the substitution repair (a wrong character consumed as an
  error span for an exact-text slot); the latency was won back by
  gating where that repair is offered (lessons 22 and 23 above), which
  cost ten lines for the `_resumes` helper against five recovered by
  condensation. Note what the score does NOT say: c12's trees are no
  longer bit-identical to c9's — that invariant ended here, deliberately,
  because c9's substitution reading was the thing being improved on.

## 5. What the archived lines taught (details in the attic)

- **dot/m-line** (budgeted deepening over the memo): the budget-horizon
  law; per-round judgment without whole-document rivalry is a ceiling —
  truncation 0.91–0.93, and one unfixable recommit case.
- **r-line** (the chart): simultaneity of judgment — its lasting gift to
  the rank — but the chart re-derives what the parse already knew.
- **b-line** (two-mode commit): D8 is decidable by classes with no
  pricing at all, and greedy commit has a proven 0.88 wall.
- **t-line** (mismatch-tree walking): the latency record (1,170 ms) and
  the proof that the tree's sideways signal is sound — but the tree
  holds each reading's FIRST failure, while recovery's information is
  every REJECTED reading (I98).
- **s-line** (the way-algebra, explicit form): the direct ancestor — the
  c-series is this algebra rebuilt on the grow-loop substrate; on the
  fair battery it holds nothing the c-line lacks.

## 6. The refutation ledger (do not retry without new evidence)

| Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Delete the budget; compute cells once | ~100x latency; the budget is the horizon (A3, twice) |
| Grammar rewriting as the engine's foundation | −0.0008, foreign trees, and the library's LR does the same work (c2) |
| Repetition through its own memo cell | 2,440 vs 1,535 ms, no accuracy change (twice) |
| Greedy commit-one-then-reparse as judgment | the b-line's 0.88 ceiling: the correct choice depends on repairs not yet made |
| Eager trees / ways as materialized trees | +20–31% latency at the tie-refresh volume (I88 ×3) |
| Ties keep incumbents / PEG-first ties | −2.6 to −3.1 perfect; latest-wins stands (×4) |
| The fee ranked below net | breaks the acceptance gate: the b2 fill out-nets its denial and must still lose |
| Universal replace edit (all slots) | zero residual cases fixed, two regressions, 2x latency |
| Per-position version bump with ubiquitous growth | battery timeout; Warth's involved-set is the rule |
| Root simplification (drop owed-admission) | recommit fails: the incoherent honest reading must displace the coherent swallow |
| Prefix-freeze with conditions (non-LR, window, clean) | its consult cost its savings; budget-zero alone is faster |
| Merging `_determined` and `_minFill` | memoizing under a cycle-cut poisons minFill inside LR paths |
| Net crediting bare `Match(null)` spans | re-weights every completion's matched prefix; −3 recommit cases |
| A literal through the memo cell (an anonymous rule) | judgment-identical, +25% latency: front ceremony on every MATCHING literal outweighs caching the failing folds |
| Rank without latest-doubt / without the stranded count | −3.4 / −2.6 perfect (re-measured on c6, post-vouch): both keys stand |
| The stranded count collapsed to a bit | −2.6 perfect, identical to dropping the tier: the count IS the tier (I105, re-confirmed era-3) |
| `spend := edits` (eof claim in the budget) | −0.0019, truncation 0.997→0.990: the additive-ledger law |
| The fee counted as an owe (`fees` into `gap`) | battery-identical, ALL gates green — rejected on the audit identity: a winning fee'd way would report an edit the tree cannot show |
| Literals through the FUSED memo, and the naked version rule | both judgment-identical, both slower: literal fronts +25%; the version rule without the dep bit −13% (cold-starts every same-position cell per growth step) |
| Stateless predicates (delete _Look's front) | judgment-identical, badly slower: the predicate's front was the ONLY cache over its Ref-to-literal sub chain — memo state acts at a distance, and "dead" state can be load-bearing for a different node's latency |
| Composite freeze cached by allocating a front per probed position | a cache whose MISS allocates a front+map at every deny-scan probe costs more than the structural matches it saves |
| The front read-view cache | judgment-identical; unresolved under machine load (paired ratios 1.00±0.10) and dropped — a front stays read-only on reads; retry on a quiet machine |
| The budget watermark folded into the version array | blocked by analysis: atBudget is a >=-ordered clock serving every smaller query; the version is an =-checked clock scoped by usedSeed. One counter cannot express both, and unscoping the version is the −13% naked-version design. The absorbable piece — "never computed" as memoVersion == −1 — was absorbed (judgment-identical) |
| Canonical cell fills (every fill at the round's full budget) | +0.0001 score, 1.6x latency — declined: most cells are only reached by mostly-spent readings, and never exploring deeper than asked is where the time goes. The lazy watermark is the design, now documented with its price |
| The strict zero fiber (budget-zero always answers with the cached plain parse, never the champion map's zero-cost view) | ADOPTED: battery-inert, ~5% faster, and the zero fiber becomes order-independent — the last query-order dependence at budget zero is gone |
| Semi-naive evaluation / avoid re-derivation (the fix BOTH outside analyses converged on) | only 29% of fills re-derive an unchanged value; the other 71% are first derivations no delta scheme can skip |
| Saturation — run each budget's fixed point to completion so rungs start warm | ~7% fewer fills, zero time won: the rung tax is the ladder's shape, not repeated work |
| Compare-before-allocate (judge a candidate from component sums, allocate only on keep) | 1.02–1.04x SLOWER, measured twice (with and without `@pragma('vm:prefer-inline')`): the avoided young allocation was nearly free, and the guard duplicates the sum arithmetic on every keep |
| Cross-run cell reuse (grow-only arrays, epoch stamps, in-place reset instead of fresh allocation) | 1.10x SLOWER: stores into old-space objects pay the GC write barrier fresh young arrays never do; c6's fresh-arrays-per-run is the optimum, not a shortcut |
| The per-op campaign (indexed loops, fold micro-shapes, terminal tweaks) | ±5% with unstable sign under load; representation was the lever (R6–R8, 1.7x), operations were noise |
| Drop the substitution repair entirely (c12) | 0.9885 / 84.4 — fails the perfect bar. The repair is required; only its offer site was negotiable |
| A non-evicting substitution (keep the swap reading beside the incumbent instead of pruning against it) | 0.9895 / 85.6 and no operation count won: eviction was not the cost, the newly opened position was |
| The substitution offered `.penalized()` | 0.9886 / 84.6 — a penalty is not a ranking-only hint; it counts into charge, so it changes what the budget can afford |
| A ranking-only `guess` bit marking swap-derived readings (tried as an early key, a late key, and cleared at construct boundaries) | 0.9891–0.9895 / 85.4–85.6: a large operation cut, but it loses six mid-array-delimiter substitutions that are EXACT ties, which is precisely where a tiebreak bit does damage |
| `(end, guess)` as the per-end pruning key | battery timed out past 600 s (from 0.6 s): two survivors per end is not a refinement, it is a second search |
| Gate the substitution on `slot.text?.length == 1` | holds the record score, but a reproducible ~15% slowdown on the CLEAN path in an A/B/A test, for no damaged gain — the check runs where nothing is damaged |
| Gate the substitution on `deletedAhead < 0` | 85.7 perfect: cheaper than `_resumes` to evaluate and strictly worse at telling a swap from a guess |

## 7. Where things live

- The engine: `dart/experiments/recovery/c12.dart` — the published
  library untouched (`lib/src` performs no recovery) plus this one
  recovery module, which consumes the library's clause objects
  natively.
- Kept for comparison: `c9.dart` (fast) and `c10.dart` (small), each
  self-contained with the full parser folded in and each reachable only
  through `_convert.dart`'s adapters; `c11.dart` with its design
  account in `c11_study.md`.
- The harness: `dart/test/recovery/` — battery + scoring
  (`astdiff.dart`), runner (`_score1.dart <engine> [dump]`), the four
  gates (`_accept.dart <engine>`, `_freespan.dart`, `_recommit.dart`,
  `_conf1.dart`), the c9/c10 adapters (`_convert.dart`), size
  (`loc.py`), and the paired-timing instrument (`_race.dart`).
- Archive: `dart/experiments/recovery/attic/` (~320 files: c1–c8, the
  s/r/m/t/b lines, ~900 scratch probes, `pareto.py` — retired when one
  engine remained — `libsrc_recovery/`, and the old lib-recovery tests);
  the era-1/era-2 record and the era-3 archive in
  `attic/OLD_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`. `attic/c8.dart` stays importable
  (`_convert.dart`'s `convertC8`) as the paired-timing and dump
  baseline.

## 8. The c7→c8 rename map

c8 is c7 with every invented identifier renamed for a reader without this
file's history, and every mechanism documented in the source in plain
language. Original squirrel-parser names (Clause, Match, Seq, First, Ref,
`match`, `inRecPath`, `foundLeftRec`, `memoVersion`, …) were kept or
mirrored. The logic is expression-for-expression identical.

c9 keeps c8's names unchanged, so this map reads onto it directly; the
c9-only additions (`_best`, `_view`, `_maxSpent`, `plain`, `asList`,
`wrapped`, `owner`, `refSrc`/`refView`, `finish`) are documented where
they live in `c9.dart`. c10 keeps the same names again (its additions —
`zeroTwin`, `_zeroFiber`, `_greedyOnly`, the fiber-split version
clocks — are documented where they live in `c10.dart`). c12 keeps them
once more, and adds `Terminal.picky`, `_readSlots`, `_resumes`,
`preferred` and `spent`, each documented at its definition.
